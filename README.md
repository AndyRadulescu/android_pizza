# android_pizza

The fronend application for the pizza_backend.

In order for this application to send information to the backend, I disabeled the firewall of backend computer, but I'm sure there's
no need for this using a forwarded ip or something else.

To run the application, just download the package and run it through the android studio envidonment.
